# CampusCare AI
## Intelligent Micro-Volunteering & Impact Intelligence Platform

---

## 1. Problem Statement

Universities promote community engagement, but student participation remains low due to time constraints, lack of awareness, and absence of flexible opportunities. Existing volunteering platforms are built for long-term commitments or large-scale funding, making them unsuitable for students who can only contribute a few hours or small micro-grants.

Campus organizations struggle with:
- Finding reliable volunteers
- Verifying task completion
- Measuring measurable impact
- Prioritizing high-value initiatives

There is no intelligent, AI-driven platform that coordinates micro-volunteering, ensures accountability, and provides real-time impact analytics.
